# Weather Conditions & Climate Change with ClimateWins
Implementing optimization techniques, including gradient descent, and employing supervised machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to determine the most effective method for predicting daily weather conditions conducive to outdoor activities and everyday comfort, commonly referred to as "pleasant" weather.
# Context
ClimateWins, a nonprofit organization, is dedicated to tackling the challenges of climate change, with a focus on the rise of extreme weather events across mainland Europe over the past 10 to 20 years. The organization recognizes the potential of advanced tools like machine learning in predicting and mitigating the impacts of these weather extremes. By analyzing weather data spanning the past century, ClimateWins aims to build a predictive model to provide valuable insights into future weather patterns and improve preparedness.
